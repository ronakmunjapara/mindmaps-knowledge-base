### **10. Versioning and Migration Strategy**

- **From .NET Framework to .NET Core**:
    - Migrate to **.NET Core** for cross-platform support.
    - Re-architecture web apps to use **ASP.NET Core MVC** or **Razor Pages**.
    - Shift from **Web Forms** to **Razor Pages** or **MVC**.
- **From .NET Core to .NET 5+**:
    - .NET Core applications can be migrated directly to **.NET 5+** with minimal changes.
    - The main task is to ensure that third-party dependencies are compatible.
